## Adams Portfolio Project
i created this portfolio as a way to show my work proffesionally to a prospective employee.
being the first page i have created fully from the ground up it provided a good challenge and a lot of learning oppurtunities
such as learning how to frame a website and how to edit each individual detail of a element.

i did end up leaving a fair amount of the links and information empty for privacy reasons but i will use this website in a more private and secure setting when going in for interviews


## Challenges
the biggest challenge with the portfolio was setting up the flex boxes and having them cooperate with eachother and cooperate with the borders i had set in place,
also setting up and configuring all the sections in general sometimes proved to be a hastle but after some minor tweaks i did end up getting everything to play nice with eachother

## Uses
i will most likely be transfering this over into flash drives and adding my actual personal information and use that as a portfolio and resume when applying to different companies.
